# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge


# I worked on this challenge with: Rootul Patel and Alan Florendo



# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

            "f" => "b",   # the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes?
            "g" => "c",   # Use a formula that subtracts four from each input character
            "h" => "d",   # Also consider end case for a,b,c,d as well as non letter characters

# Reflection
#This was a fun exercise. I enjoyed reading through the provided ruby code and trying to refactor it. Learned a ton about converting to arrays and even messed around with ASCII.
